// This is when the database actually gets created
const newDoctor = new Doctor({ name: "Dr. Smith", speciality: "Cardiologist" })
await newDoctor.save() // ← Database "prescripto" is created NOW!
```

## **MongoDB's Lazy Creation Principle:**

MongoDB follows **"lazy creation"**:
- **Databases** are created when the first collection is created
- **Collections** are created when the first document is inserted

So your connection says "I want to use `prescripto`", but MongoDB says "I'll create it when you actually store something in it."

## **Visual Timeline:**
```
1. mongoose.connect() → "I want to use 'prescripto' database"
   └─ Database prescripto: Does NOT exist yet ❌

2. First data insertion → await doctor.save()
   └─ Database prescripto: NOW created! ✅
   └─ Collection 'doctors': NOW created! ✅
